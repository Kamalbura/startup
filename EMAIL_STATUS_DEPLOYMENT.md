- **Current Status**: Using console mode for development

### ‚úÖ **What's Working**
- Backend API endpoints responding correctly
- OTP generation and validation logic functional
- Professional email templates ready
- App password generated: `hQNVbYxNeTR1`

## üîß EMAIL SETUP COMPLETION CHECKLIST

### **Immediate Action Required:**

1. **‚úÖ Domain Verification**
   - Ensure `campuskarma.burakamal.site` is fully verified in Zoho Mail
   - Check DNS records are propagated (MX, SPF)
   - Verify domain ownership completion

2. **‚úÖ Email Account Creation**
   - Create `noreply@campuskarma.burakamal.site` in Zoho Mail admin
   - Create `support@campuskarma.burakamal.site` 
   - Set passwords and confirm accounts are active

3. **‚úÖ SMTP Testing**
   - Test SMTP connection with real credentials
   - Verify email delivery to both Gmail and college emails
   - Confirm app password works correctly

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### **Option 1: Deploy with Console Mode (Immediate)**
```bash
# Current setup - works for development/demo
EMAIL_SERVICE=console  # OTPs shown in server logs
```
**Pros**: Can deploy immediately, full functionality for demo
**Cons**: Production users won't receive actual emails

### **Option 2: Complete Email Setup First (Recommended)**
```bash
# After Zoho Mail setup
EMAIL_SERVICE=smtp     # Real email delivery
```
**Pros**: Full production functionality
**Cons**: Need to complete domain verification first

## üìã DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **For Immediate Demo Deployment:**

1. **Deploy to Vercel** with console mode
2. **Test full application flow** (users won't get emails but can see OTPs in logs)
3. **Fix email in parallel** while app is live
4. **Switch to SMTP** once email is working

### **Commands to Deploy:**

```bash
# 1. Ensure we're in root directory
cd /d C:\Users\burak\Desktop\startup-1

# 2. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# 3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://burakamal13:...
JWT_SECRET=campuskarma-production-secret-2024
EMAIL_SERVICE=console  # Change to 'smtp' when ready
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@campuskarma.burakamal.site
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@campuskarma.burakamal.site
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@campuskarma.burakamal.site
SMTP_PASS=hQNVbYxNeTR1
```

1. ‚úÖ Full application functionality works
2. ‚úÖ Authentication flow is complete
3. ‚úÖ Database and API are production-ready
4. ‚úÖ Frontend routes and UI are polished
